"""Build the PCB for the design in design.py.

Four layers: signals on F.Cu and B.Cu, a solid AGND plane on In1.Cu and a
V+ plane on In2.Cu. That choice is what keeps the routing simple and the
board quiet -- every supply and ground connection becomes a via rather than
a track, and the high-impedance piezo traces run directly over an unbroken
ground plane.

V- is NOT a plane. At about 2mA it never needed one, and a B.Cu pour was this
project's worst failure mode: fragmenting it produced unconnected items in
parts of the board nowhere near the cause. It is routed like any other net,
in route_supply(), and B.Cu is a second signal layer.

The board is three blocks, each one OPA4191 serving two channels. The quad's
pinout does most of the work: every pin of buffers A and B is on the left of
the package and every pin of all-passes C and D is on the right, so a
channel's buffer feedback stays entirely left, its all-pass feedback entirely
right, and the only net that has to cross the package is BUFOUT -- which is a
low-impedance node and can go anywhere.

Track waypoints are given relative to real pad positions read back from the
placed footprints, so nothing here depends on guessing KiCad's rotation
conventions.

Reading order, roughly outwards: route_planes() drops every plane pad onto
its plane; route_critical() lays BUFIN before anything can take its space;
route_channel() does one channel and is called six times; route_board()
carries OUT and the switched nodes out to the tail connector and the
switches; route_supply() does V- and the control net.

    `s` points away from the quad: -1 for the odd channel on the row above,
    +1 for the even one below. Every offset is multiplied by it, so both
    halves of a block come out of the same code and cannot drift apart.

    Two structural facts decide the whole thing.

    **The row line is the only place a net can change sides.** Row parts and
    sub-row parts sit on two parallel lines with the band between them, and
    the quad sits on the far side of the row. So every net that leaves the
    package for a sub-row part crosses the row line exactly once, and the
    crossings have to be shared out between the gaps in it. The gaps are
    measured, not assumed: a 1206 leaves 1.8mm between its own two pads, and
    that is where most of the crossings go.

    **A net leaving the package deeper than another cannot turn towards the
    row inside the other's span.** The three right-hand pins come out at
    three different depths, and their targets run the opposite way along the
    row -- so the natural order is exactly backwards. APOUT, the shallowest
    pin with the furthest target, is the one that has to give: it crosses the
    row line immediately and makes its traverse on B.Cu, under the band, and
    the other two then cross it without touching it. It is a low-impedance
    op-amp output, so the layer change costs nothing.

    B.Cu carries what has to traverse the block -- OUT, APOUT, the switched
    node's jump under C02, and both buffer feedback nets under the package.
    That is only affordable because V- is no longer a pour: a crossing costs
    two vias rather than a hole in the negative rail.
